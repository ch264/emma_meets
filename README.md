Emma Meets was created to provide a social media platform, for dog owners to find and leave reviews for dog related products. Users can sign up, reset their password by email, create a profile for their dog, browse existing products in the database, leave reviews and favorite products to their profile page. In addition they can remove these as well as their reviews. Each review has a rating that is dispayed as an average rating on the product page itself and in the product cards on the profile. If a user does not find a dog-related product on the page, they can create a category, which populates in a dropdown menu in the create product page. here they can upload an appropriate picture and information about the product they would like to review. After they are done, they can logout again.

## User stories

Emma Meets is a community platform for dog owners who only want the best for their pooches. When encountering a product that has helped the owner or the dog, they can share their experience on Emma Meets and help other dogs/owners decide on which products to go for. 
Our users love their dogs and love talking about them. Each dog has their own profile displaying the most important characteristics of the dog. This will help with the future implementation of elastic search where dogs will be able to search for other dogs in their location, by breed or favorite toy etc.
Our users are looking for a community of other user that love their dogs as much as they do.
